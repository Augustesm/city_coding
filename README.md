# city_coding

### This C# project leverages the power of console tables, ITablePrintable interface, and public classes to efficiently display essential information about cities. The code prints details such as city size, area, founding time, airport availability, city name, and flag color using well-organized lists, providing a clear and structured representation of urban data.
